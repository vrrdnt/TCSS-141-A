## set up a variable called odds and calculate the number of odd numbers in
## a list. If you calculate odds for list1, 2 should be printed;
## if on list 2, 4 should be printed

print(odds)

## set up a variable called newList that contains original list elements
## rotated to the right (you should probably use some of the Python built-in
## list methods - check Python docs)
## for list1 the new list should result in [4, 4, 1, 2, 3]
## for list2 the new list should result in [7, 1, 3, 5]

print(newList)

## set up a variable called anotherList that contains original list elements
## multiplied by a number entered by a user, except when the original list number
## is already a multiple of the number entered by the user, for example
## for list1 and a value 3,
## anotherList should contain [12, 3, 6, 3, 12]

print(anotherList)


## check whether the first or the last value in a list is larger and replace
## all original values in a list with the larger of the two, for example,
## the new version of list1, called changedList and will contain [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

print(changedList)
