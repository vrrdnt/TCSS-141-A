# a.  
Write a program named `Formatting.py` that does the following:  
#### Set up two variables (`s1` and `s2`) to hold strings (`“This”` and `“That”`) and two more variables (`i1` and `i2`) to hold integers (`123` and `-5`).  
Then write appropriate print statements that use these variables and the format method to print the following to the console  
(the blue numbers on top indicate positioning):
```
12345678901234567890
      That      This
   123        -5    
   This      That   
123.00
 -5.00 
```  

# b.  
Write a program named `WhenInRome.py` that asks the user for a number in the range of `1` through `10`.  
The program should then display the Roman numeral version of that number:  
`1 is I`, `2 is II`, `3 is III`, `4 is IV`, `5 is V`, `6 is VI`, `7 is VII`, `8 is VIII`, `9 is IX`, `10 is X`.  
The program should display an error message if the user enters a number that is outside the range 1 through 10.
