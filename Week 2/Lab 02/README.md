# a. 
Using the provided link in the Lab 2 assignment page on Canvas, download the program called trickyText.py.  
It contains several errors. Find and fix them. Once you fix one mistake, you will want to re-run the program before fixing another one.  
You will want to run the program in IDLE and see what kinds of error messages  
are shown for each kind of mistake â€“ you will see such messages over and over again, so this is the good time to learn their meaning.  
The program should produce the following output:  
```
'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'  
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.  
'I don't much care where--' said Alice.  
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.  
'--so long as I get somewhere,' Alice added as an explanation.  
'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.'
```
# b.  
Using the provided link in the Lab 2 assignment page on Canvas, download the program called tricky2.py.  
It contains several errors.  Find and fix them. The program should correctly use the flexibility of variables to produce the following output:  
```
x is 6  
x is now 30  
x and y are 30 and 31
```
