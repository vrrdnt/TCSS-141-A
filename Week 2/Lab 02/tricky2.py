# I declare the variable, and then print it using string concatenation.
# The str() function converts the integer 6 (x) into a string, which
# allows me to insert it into another string.

x = 6
print("x is " + str(x))

x = 30
print("x is now " + str(x))

y = x + 1
print("x and y are " + str(x) + " and " + str(y))
