# I declare the variable, and then print it using string concatenation.
# We can either use str() to print the integer variables with the strings,
# or we can pass them as extra parameters. Doing the latter is cleaner.

x = 6
print("x is", x)

x = 30
print("x is now", x)

y = x + 1
print("x and y are", x, "and", y)
